It oversees the lifecycle of the extension by initializing collaborative sessions and managing the SidePanelUI, which presents vital information to users.\nAt the heart of the system is the CollaborationSession, which represents an active editing session. This session maintains details about connected collaborators, the shared files, and the overall state of the collaboration. It unites multiple Users, each with their own identity, role, and editing activities. To operate seamlessly, the session relies on two pivotal components: the FileManager, which synchronizes file edits and resolves conflicts, and the CommunicationManager, which ensures that messages, updates, and file changes are distributed in real time to all users.\nUser activity is monitored by the UserActivityTracker, which tracks the actions performed by each participant, such as edits and navigation. These logs are then relayed to the AIAgent, which analyzes the data to discern what each team member is working on. The AI processes this information and generates an ActivityReport that summarizes team progress and highlights individual contributions.\nUltimately, the SidePanelUI displays these reports within Visual Studio Code, giving collaborators real-time visibility into each other\u2019s work. This functionality ensures that participants not only share files and edits but also gain insight into the overall workflow of the team, thereby enhancing transparency and coordination."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,t,s)=>{s.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var i=s(96540);const n={},a=i.createContext(n);function o(e){const t=i.useContext(a);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:o(e.components),i.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
