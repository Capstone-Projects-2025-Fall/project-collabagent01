## Getting Started with Collab Agent 01 for Peer Review

This guide will walk you through installing the extension from the VS Code Marketplace and logging in with your GitHub account.

### Step 1: Install the Extension

2. Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (the vertical toolbar on the far-left side of your window).

3. In the search bar that appears, type: Collab Agent 01.

7. Click this new icon to open the extension's main panel.

### Step 2: Sign In with GitHub

2. Click the button and choose Sign In (do not select "Sign Up").

3. On the next screen, click the "Sign In with GitHub" button.

4. VS Code will ask for permission to open an external website. Click Open.

5. Your web browser will open to a GitHub authorization page. Click the green Authorize button.
