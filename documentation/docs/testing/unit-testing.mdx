# Unit tests

## Testing Framework

We chose Jest as the testing framework because it works well with our TypeScript and JavaScript codebase, is easy to set up, and has built-in support for mocking and stubbing.

### Key Features

Mocking: Can fake modules and VS Code APIs so tests run on their own.

Auto Test Discovery: Finds and runs all test files automatically.

Assertions: Check results, function calls, and objects easily.

Code Coverage: Shows what parts of the code are tested.

Async Support: Works with async/await for things like team creation.

Test Isolation: Resets mocks and sets up fresh instances before each test.

### Suitability
Handles complex dependencies like VS Code APIs.

Supports async operations without extra setup.

Works well with TypeScript using ts-jest.

Good for VS Code extension testing (webviews, commands, extension lifecycle).

Easy to use in CI/CD pipelines.

## Running Frontend Testing

To run all frontend (extension) test cases:

1. Navigate to the extension folder:
```bash
cd extension
```

2. Run the test command:
```bash
npm run test
```

This will run all Jest test suites for the VS Code extension, including:
- Extension tests (25 test suites)
- 343+ unit tests covering services, API calls, and components

## Running Backend Testing

To run all backend (server) test cases:

1. Navigate to the server folder:
```bash
cd server
```

2. Run the pytest command:
```bash
python -m pytest
```

This will run all pytest test suites for the Flask backend, including:
- API route tests
- Database tests
- Authentication tests
- 86+ unit tests covering all backend functionality
