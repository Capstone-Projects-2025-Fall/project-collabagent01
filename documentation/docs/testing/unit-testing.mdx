# Unit tests

## Testing Framework

We chose Jest as the testing framework because it works well with our TypeScript and JavaScript codebase, is easy to set up, and has built-in support for mocking and stubbing.

## Key Features:

Mocking: Can fake modules and VS Code APIs so tests run on their own.

Auto Test Discovery: Finds and runs all test files automatically.

Assertions: Check results, function calls, and objects easily.

Code Coverage: Shows what parts of the code are tested.

Async Support: Works with async/await for things like team creation.

Test Isolation: Resets mocks and sets up fresh instances before each test.

## Suitability
Handles complex dependencies like VS Code APIs.

Supports async operations without extra setup.

Works well with TypeScript using ts-jest.

Good for VS Code extension testing (webviews, commands, extension lifecycle).

Easy to use in CI/CD pipelines.
