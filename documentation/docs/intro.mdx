# Introduction

Collab Agent is a VS Code extension that helps development teams work together on coding projects. We've built it to handle team setup, project management, and real-time collaboration, with AI features planned to make everything smoother.
We leverage the Live Share API to enable instant collaborative coding sessions. Hosts can generate shareable session links that teammates can use to join live coding environments. This functionality delivers a Google Docs-like experience for code, where all participants can see changes in real-time as they occur.
