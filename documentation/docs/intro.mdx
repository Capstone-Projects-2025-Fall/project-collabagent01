# CollabAgent

CollabAgent is an AI-assisted collaboration tool designed to support software development teams. It provides code change summaries, task awareness, and real-time context inside the development environment.

## Introduction

CollabAgent helps teams maintain awareness of ongoing work within a shared codebase. When multiple contributors work asynchronously, it can be difficult to keep track of recent updates, task progress, and individual responsibilities. This system collects code changes, Jira activity, and collaboration data, then presents it in a structured and accessible format.

The main objective is to reduce the time spent interpreting diffs or asking teammates for context.

## What is CollabAgent?

CollabAgent is a development support tool that integrates code analysis, Jira task data, and team activity streams. By observing updates in the repository and project board, it generates summaries and insights that make it easier for team members to stay informed.

Users interact with CollabAgent through a VS Code extension, making the workflow accessible within their existing tools.

## How It Works

- **Track:** Monitor various things like file changes, Jira tasks, user activity, and more!
- **Summarize:** Uses top-of-the-line AI models to generate descriptions of code changes and project activity.  
- **Recommend:** Have AI suggest tasks or areas of focus based on the user's skill profile.  
- **Information:** Displays recent team activity through a shared timeline.  

## Who Is This For?

- Developers working in collaborative repositories  
- Teams using asynchronous workflows  
- Groups that manage tasks through Jira  
- Anyone who benefits from automated summaries of code and task changes  

## Why You Might Use It

- **Context Awareness:** Quickly understand codebase updates without manually reviewing all diffs.  
- **Integrated Task Information:** Access Jira task changes and assignments in the same workspace.  
- **Skill-Based Recommendations:** Receive suggested tasks aligned with your experience and strengths.  
- **Team Activity Timeline:** View commits, task transitions, comments, and summaries in one place.  
- **Reduced Manual Overhead:** Less need for detailed commit messages or repeated explanations.
