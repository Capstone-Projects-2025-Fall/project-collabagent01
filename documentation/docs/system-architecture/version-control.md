# Version Control
## Project Management & Workflow

This project is managed via Git and GitHub and utilizes **Docusaurus** for documentation.

### Branching Strategy

We adhere to the following workflow to maintain code stability:

- **Main Branch** This branch holds the most up-to-date and stable version of the project. All changes will be merged into `main` via pull requests.

- **Sprint Branching** At the start of each sprint, new branches will be created. This ensures that updates are not immediately pushed to `main`, safeguarding against unforeseen errors. These branches will accumulate any new features added during the sprint.

- **End of Sprint Merging** At the end of each sprint, we will review the sprint and push the approved features to `main`. This step ensures that anything added or updated is stable before the final merge.
