/**
 * Team Service Test Suite
 * 
 * Note: These tests are currently stubs and would need proper mocking
 * of Supabase and authentication services to run properly.
 * 
 * To run these tests in the future:
 * 1. Set up proper mocking for @supabase/supabase-js
 * 2. Mock the auth-service module
 * 3. Configure test environment variables
